Hidden Homeland 
Ritual of Complement, 
requires 5 people who know how to cast it, 
takes 10 hours to cast with components V, S, M (all the spell slots of each caster, experience points equal to (500+1024*(radius of area being protected in feet/5)^2))). 
This spell requires that the building or settlement being protected be surrounded by closely packed trees (assume that they follow a sphere packing system that is 50% efficient relative to the ground where the spheres in this model representing the trees have a maximum radius for fitting the packing scheme of 20X the diameter of the respective tree) that are contiguous along any horizontal line outward from the settlement to a distance of, at minimum, max(1 mile, twice the longest line that can be drawn along the protected settlements/buildings). 
This spell prohibits creatures other than those already within the building or settlement and those allowed by the casters (either before or after the spell is cast) from entering or seeing the settlement or building. Observed from above as just a normal continuation of the forest, anyone who tries to go toward the protected settlement will always take a path that leads elsewhere in the surrounding forest. This choice is enforced by the equivalent of a permanent series of Mass Suggestion spells that have no saving throw. 
The trees in the area become immune to fire, non-magical piercing, non-magical bludgeoning, non-magical slashing and poison damage and exhaustion (i.e. drought or bad soil) and will have (in the absence of powerful magical effects like Meteor Swarm,  Earthquake or Killing Storm) regrowth at a suitable rate to maintain appearances.
