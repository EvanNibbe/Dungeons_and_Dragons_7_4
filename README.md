# Dungeons_and_Dragons_7_4
This game replaces many of the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition with rules that fit better within the context of implementing the game in a real-world scenario. This entails removing all classes other than Sorcerer, Warlock, Cleric and Druid, changing up each of those classes so that they have fewer dependencies, and otherwise placing every other playable race in the context of either inclined towards fighting (advantage on strength and dexterity-based ability checks, disadvantage on intelligence and wisdom-based ability checks) or inclined towards wizardry (advantage on intelligence and wisdom-based ability checks, disadvantage on strength and dexterity-based ability checks). This also fundamentally changes the "bounded accuracy" mechanic of D&amp;D 5e while maintaining the spirit of it by replacing nearly all d20 rolls with uniform distributions based on raw ability scores so that even the lowliest of people can succeed a charisma save against a powerful caster that turned themselves into a powerful creature to have a maximum of synergies.
