Erosion- Corrosion 
Ritual of Complement 
requires 5 people who know how to cast it, 
takes 1 hour to cast with 
components V, S, M (all the spell slots of each caster, experience points equal to min(500+1024*(radius of area being hit in feet/5)^2), 10000*(number of buildings (including treehouses and cave/hole dwellings) being hit))). 
This spell ignores all magical/other protections on buildings in the chosen area with the exception that this spell cannot reach across the boundary created by Protection of City. 
This spell replicates the effect of thousands of years of category 5 hurricane-sandstorm-blizzards on all things in sight that could reasonably be made into a dwelling for an animal (this includes the decimation of underground catacombs, coffins and bones) to instead be made into loam suitable for growing trees. This spell does not target creatures (other than things like collapsing a treehouse to just be a tree, or collapsing the internal space of a mech suit that is not currently in use as a means other than as a dwelling).
